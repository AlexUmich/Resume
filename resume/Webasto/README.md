# Webasto internship
The DataCollection program is what I worked on during the last chunk of my main internship time period.

First time using C#, learned about communication programs and data transferring. It was a functionally complete program with logging, error handling, etc. Worked well/did its intended job when applied.

The PressParam program is very similar to the DataCollection one, same setup, but with some changes for its different application.

Included both files just to show everything C# related. Missing some basic script writing that I don't have anymore.
