# Autotensioning program
This was one of many programs used at our lab, and one that I made almost in its entirety. However, it also calls upon a few other files that others contributed.

This program creates the main GUI, controls a stepper motor responsible for tensioning tube wires in our lab, and calls upon other files to create a real-time tension graph and save values to the database.

This link: https://github.com/dravinflores/smdt is to the public repo for our MSU lab, and all related code can be found there (other than the final Autotension file version that I have here.

Long program, but the code/logic isn't anything crazy
